Snake game using an arduino and various electrical components.

**Task Requirements**: Create a game. It must be fun and intuitive, and also remember that it is your game! Pick something that you like and have fun creating it.

**Menu Requirements**:
• Menu Task: Create a menu for your game, emphasis on the game. You
should scroll on the LCD with the joystick. Remember you have quite a
lot of flexibility here, but do not confuse that with a free ticket to slack
off. The menu should include the following functionality:
  1. When powering up a game, a greeting message should be shown for
a few moments.
  2. Should contain roughly the following categories:
    (a) Start game, starts the initial level of your game
    (b) Highscore:
      – Initially, we have 0.
      – Update it when the game is done. Highest possible score should be achieved by starting at a higher level.
      – Save the top 3 values in EEPROM with name and score

**Components**: 16 Segment Led Display, 8x8 Led Matrix, MAX7219 Driver, Joystick, Buzzer, 10k Potentiometer, Capacitors, Resistors and Wires.
